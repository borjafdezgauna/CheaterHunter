2017/11/24: We have done the first Task completely and successfully 
            and we have started the second task by doing the first part of it.

2017/11/27: We have finished the second task and applied the legend to all the plots of the other day,
            and also change the subplots to the asked ones.

2017/12/01: We have started the third task by understanding the objectives and we only have left to substitute the results
            by what we are asked to put and we have put notes to notice that when we have the results(plot,speed limits...)
            we have tu put there. Also, we have started the task 4 but with problems with the interpolation, so we have done
            only the magnitude change.

2017/12/04: We have corrected the firs exercise putting together by using subplots and then we have finished the third task and
            we have put the first and the second plots there and we hope to put more while we are finishing the following activities.
            Also we have done the first three parts of the task 4.

2017/12/11: We have tried the fourth part of the fourth task without success, so we have started with the fifth part. We hope to
           understand the fourth part the next day so we can finish the fourth part as fast as possible.

2017/12/16: The last day(2017/12/15) we tried to completely undderstand how to interpolate, because, even we understand the general idea, 
            we didn´t know how to programm it. Also, we changed the fifth part of the fourth task, putting "sprintf"(Sprintf today). Today, we have met to
            finish the task four(fourth and sixth part) because we were told that we should finish it for the tuesday. So we have done it, by completing 
            it succesfully by changing also the other parts, to adapt them to the final result, so this would be okay. Also, we have implemented it in the 
            third task and we hope to do the fifth task before the exam. 

2017/12/18: Today we have started the task 5, by doing the first part succesfully and we have also finished the 5.2 successfully. At first we have some
            Problems with the 1st and the 2nd part, but we finally fix it and we obtain the correct results. We hope to finish the fifth task the next day
            and to write the explanations the next day.

2017/12/21: Today we have finished the task 5 by completing the 3rd part, and then by putting them inside the 3rd task. Also, we have put the explanations 
            inside each task and subtask. 

2017/12/22: Today we have started the task 6 by doing the first subtask and also, we have studied for the exam, reviewing the previous tasks

2017/12/22 V2: When I reached home I realise that we hadn´t done standard variation and I wasn´t able to do it in the exam but when I reached home I have
               done it to know how to do it even I haven´t done it in the exam.(Antxon)
