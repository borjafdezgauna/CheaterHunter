Upload 1: We have almost finished the first task but we have to fix some problems 

Upload 2: We are fixing the task 1. Instead of repeating things we have tried to introduce ‘for’, but as the code works without the ‘for’ and it was much more difficult we decided to avoid using it in this task. We have also start the second task. We have some problems with the name of the plots and we are trying to make it set right. 

Upload 3:  After trying it, we achieved to do the task 1 using ‘’for’’. We had to modify a great part of our code but the improvement is big. Now we are working on the third task, the menu, and we have almost finish it.

Upload 4:    We have finished the menu and it works. We are now developing  the task 4 but we have trouble with the ‘’estimated time’’. 

Upload 5:    We have met the free days (“the constitution bridge”) and we have almost finished the project. We faced some problems such as the problems with the ‘’check speed limits’’ which is a function that tell us the current speed limit on the road. The problems was that we didn´t know what the for condition was. We finally fixed the problem with the ‘’estimated time’’.and also the previous one. 
The last two tasks seemed easier, than the forth, once we understood the interpolation what takes a great time.
We completed the menu with the remaining cases 
In the following days we are going to verify that everything works well, organize our project and tidy it. 
we also had change the first task because using the ‘for’ we weren´t able to save the PNG file.

It´s only left the 6º task .


Upload 6    We have finished everything. Also we have change the order in the task 2 and fix little problems such as “ %f ”,” %.2f ”, “ ; ”... 
We have completed task 6, and we have created a function that calculates the acceleration in each slice, apart from the main function.
