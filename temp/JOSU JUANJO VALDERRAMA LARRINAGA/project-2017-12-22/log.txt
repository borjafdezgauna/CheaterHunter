We finally finished the whole task 4! 

Task1: It was alredy finished but we added some comments to the code in order to make it easy to understand

Task2: Same as task 1

Task3: Same as previous tasks. We also finished the 'Press any key to continue' part that we didn't do the first time we uploaded it.

Task4: We started last Friday working on it and after having many problems, especially with 4.4, we finished it yesterday.

Finally, we have created a folder which contains all the tasks together so that it is easier to find all the correct work we have done.
