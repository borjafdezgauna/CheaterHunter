First we have done task1.It only plots 1 graph. 
we got it to work by changing the position of the subplots.

2017/11/21
Task 2 seems easy but we havent had time to finish it.

2017/11/27
we have finished task 2 and started to create the files for task 3.

2017/11/28
we have started task 4 and left task 3 for later(as it is a menu).

2017/12/05
We are very close to getting task 4 to work. 
We have nearly finished Task 3.

2017/12/12
We checked and task 1 had a problem when saving the png, it's ok now.
We have also found a problem in task 2 which we havent been able to solve yet.
Still working on the estimatetime function.


2017/12/18
Can't get task2 to work but we have finished the estimatetime function and the toHMS in task4.
we just have to finish task4

2017/12/19
We have fixed Task 2 and it's now fully working. We have started to work on Task 5 while we try 
to fix the final script in task4.(we don't know why its plotting incorrectly)

2017/12/20
We have finally got task4 working!!! And task5 seems to be going well. The sad part is that 
we don't have time to do task6. :(

2017/12/21
We have finished task5 and therefore, all we have time to do.
We have also fixed Task3 by changing the while and some other things.(We have made some changes 
to the names of the files and some directories so that the 
mainMenu can open the scripts.)
Also fix the problem in Task1(we used to see complex numbers).


Hope everything works, have a nice day!! ;)
