Borja introduces and explains the project for the first time with all the rules and specifications.
Team groups are made.
Despite we haven't got a computer, we start to think in the task one on paper.

Friday 2017-11-24

Task 1: Working on the task one keeps going. 
We are testing different ways to do this task but many errors appear.
Even with the errors, we're trying new possible ideas.
we obtain the two plots, but we still have to do the second part of the exercises

Monday 2017-11-27
Task-1: We already have part a done. We are working on part b. Task-1 is almost complete.
We obtained the image and the plot is correctly labelled.


Tuesday 2017-11-28
Task-1: The task is already finished, we put the titles of the plots
and we reached the point where we were able to save .png file in the same folder as the scripts. Part b of the task is done.
Now,we should start task-2 next day.

We have started task 2, and its going very fluent.
So that, with all de data and functions, there's no chance of any big problem.
Task 2 is about to end in this session, in just an hour.
Task 2 finished.

Now we're testing the third task (Task 3), probing some comands looking for the correct ones.
The menu has been written and seems to work perfectly.

Monday 2017-12-4
Task 3 (scripts.m) is almost finished, but Octave shows an error opening mainMenu.m, we don't specify the numbers 3,4 and 5 because this scripts there aren't done yet.

Saturday 2017-12-9
We have started doing task 4, we have reached subtasks 1,2 and 3. We are now working on sub-task 4. We prefer to
do task 3 in the end, because we think is the easiest one.

Friday 2017-12-15
We committed a mistake uploading the wrong file so the things that we worked on disappeared.

Tuesday 2017-12-19
Due to Friday's mistake we have had to repeat last day's work.
And that work was:
-Task-3: finished. We change the name of the scripts. The input script is now called 'script' and the menu script is now called 'mainMenu'.
-Task-4: finished. We fixed the 'estimateTime' script introducing an if. We fixed 'toHMS' script to get the right string and we printed the right times for each route

Friday 2017-12-22
We have ended the project today. We have done until task-4, we started task-5, but it doesn't work properly. 
Today, we have changed some things in task-1 and task-2, for example we eliminated the for loops, because we think they are unnecesary.
Now, we are going to put the correspondent scripts for each task:
Task-1: 'heights' and 'route-elevations.png'.
Task-2: 'speeds' and 'route-speed.png'.
Task-3: 'script' and 'mainMenu'.
Task-4: 'interpolateLinearly', 'toMeters', 'toMetersPerSecond', 'estimateTime', 'toHMS' and 'timesroutes'.
Task-5: 'interpolateToTheLeft', 'checkSpeedLimits' and 'limits'. It only works the first function.
